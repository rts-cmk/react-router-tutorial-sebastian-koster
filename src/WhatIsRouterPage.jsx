        <h1>What is a Router?</h1>
        <p>A router is a library that helps manage navigation and rendering of different components based on the URL in a web application. It allows developers to create single-page applications (SPAs) where users can navigate between different views without triggering a full page reload.</p>
        <p>Routers work by mapping URL paths to specific components, enabling dynamic content rendering based on the current route. This enhances user experience by providing faster navigation and a more seamless interaction with the application.</p>
